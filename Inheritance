# In the first step, you will create a parent class. Create a parent class for Office Furniture. Set the class
# variables to be a category (desk, chair, filing cabinet would be examples), material, length, width, height,
# and price. Include a method that returns a string about the object.
# In the second step create a subclass for Desk that includes location_of_drawers (left, right both are
# options) and number_drawers. Override the parents __str__ method to include drawer location and count.
# Implement each class in a separate file. Import these into your main program. Your main program should
# implement and display an instance of each, the parent class and the child class.
